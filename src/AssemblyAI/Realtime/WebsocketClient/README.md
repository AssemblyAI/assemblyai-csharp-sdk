WebsocketClient is based on the open-source WebsocketClient package.
https://github.com/Marfusios/websocket-client

We modified the source code to reduce the amount of dependencies, and to target .NET standard 2.0.
Removing dependencies and targeting .NET Standard 2.0 increases the compatibility and reach of the library.
FE. WebsocketClient was not compatible with the version of Unity engine we tried.
